# Examining cognitive biases in ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 through human evaluation and linguistic comparison
In this page you can find the report analysis and all the results achieved in the paper "Examining cognitive biases in ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 through human evaluation and linguistic comparison” by Giada Pantana and Marta Castello. 
The results are divided in “Demographics” for all human data and “GPT results and comparison” for the ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 data, with prompts and answers. In both repositories you can find a “General” file that reports all data and calculations. The human data are subdivided for each task, namely Julia=Representativeness heuristics, Yes_No=Availability heuristics, Mountains=Framing. The GPT results are instead divided by the tool. In each tool file you can find a pdf reporting all the prompts and the 56 outputs given by each LLM. 
A final document called “Corpora” contains the name, link and data of the corpora examined to determine the Representativeness heuristics correct answers.
